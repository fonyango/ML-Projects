### Locust Stories
This project uses Natural Language Processing(NLP) to understand locust invasion in East Africa using news articles by media companies. It is still an ongoing project...

So far notebooks are as follows;

__news_article_scraper.ipynb__ is the web scraper for getting the articles using the collected urls.
__preprocessing.ipynb__ has code for merging the different csv files from different news websites to form the final csv file. It also contains preprocessing codes for the dataset.
__news_titles.ipynb__ does the NLP work on the news article titles. This includes; exploration and visualization, word frequency, N-grams, named entity recognition (NER), topic modelling (TM) and parts of speech taging.
